Hi, I have created a repository where I will store all of my leadCode code. My first leadCode project was project 22 Generate Parentheses. To be honest, I didn't really code it myself rather I looked at someone's code for 5 seconds, then typed everything I learned. Anything that I forgot, I tried to fix and solve it. I forgot one major component which trying to type what I remember. I spent a hour figuring out how to solve it. I did it by myself.
